        <p>Pictures capture our most important moments of life.  I view my skills as a photographer to be a gift, and I work hard to be on the cutting edge of my craft.  When you trust me to capture your most precious moments, I commit to doing my absolute best to provide your family with memories you will treasure for life.</p>
        <p>The older we get, the more we realize how valuable these moments truly are. Time sure does fly by, whether we want it to or not, and priceless memories can fade away. A camera can freeze a slice of life, a face, an expression, a personality, a moodâ€” There is magic in that moment. A picture becomes a sample of life, captured at that exact moment. How blessed we are to have the technology to do this. It takes a skilled photographer, with a trained eye and sensitivity to those moments, to make images that will impact you.</p>
        <p>My hope is that experiences in my life as a wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, and numerous other roles, will bring beauty and grace to your most valuable memories that you can re-live for a lifetime.  </p>
